        <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>

        <p>Pudge</p>
        <p>In the fields of Eternal Carnage, far south of Quoij, a corpulent figure labors hard under cover of night - removing and then dismembering, gutting, heaping the limbs and internal organs of the fallen. And all this just so that the next morning the massacre could be repeated. In that damned world, nothing decays on its own - the dead are never destined to return back to the earth, no matter how deep the grave is. Surrounded by flocks of scavengers looking for sliced ​​corpses, the butcher Pudge exercises with blades that are sharpened from cutting corpses. Whack-whack-tukh. Flesh is ripped from bones, ligaments and tendons are ripped off like pieces of wet paper. And while Pudge has always had a passion for the butcher's craft, over time, the overweight big guy also fell in love with what happens when he finishes work on a corpse. First, a piece of muscle there, a sip of blood ... Soon Pudge was already gnawing into the bodies of the strongest creatures like a dog gnawing a bone. Even those who have no fear of the Reaper of Death prefer not to mess with the butcher.</p>
